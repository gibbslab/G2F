g2f : Find and Fill Gaps in Metabolic Networks
======
The **g2f** package was designed as a tool to find and fill gaps in metabolic networks. For a given metabolic network, this package finds the gaps (metabolites not produced or not consumed in any other reaction), and fills it from the stoichiometric reactions of a reference metabolic reconstruction using a weighting function. Also the option to download all the set of gene-associated stoichiometric reactions for a specific organism from the KEGG database <http://www.genome.jp/kegg/> is available.

Install:
--------
This package required R version 2.10 or higher. If you are using an older version of R you will be prompted to upgrade when you try to install the package.

For install the latest stable version this package directly from GitHub:
```
# Install 'devtools' R package
install.packages("devtools")

# Install 'g2f' package
devtools::install_github("gibbslab/g2f")
library("g2f")
```

Available functions:
-------------------
|Function | Description |
|:--------|:------------|
|additionCost|Calculate the cost of addition of a stoichiometric reaction in a metabolic network|
|blockedReactions|Identify blocked reactions in a metabolic network|
|gapFill|Find and fill gaps in a metabolic network|
|getReference|Download all the set of gene-associated stoichiometric reactions for a specific organism from the KEGG database|
